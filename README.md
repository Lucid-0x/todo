| order  | meaning | features | examples |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| a | add a new task  | adding a {number} will **repeat the order** -- leaving task empty will skip it -- | `a` -- `a 2`|
| c {line number} | check a task | adding ',' and multiple numbers will check them all at once | `c 3` -- `c 3,4`|
| uc {line number} | uncheck a task | adding ',' and multiple numbers will check them all at once | `uc 3` -- `uc 3,4` |
| m | modifiy a task | adding ',' and multiple numbers will check them all at once | `m 3` -- `m 3,4` |
|  |  | | |
| random | display one task to do if you dont know what to do | N/A | `random` |
| help | print these instructions | N/a | `help` |
| clear | delete all tasks | N/a | `clear` |
| exit | exit the program | you can quit by clicking `ctrl + c` üëÄ | `exit` |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Features and tips

1- the tasks will always displayed so you don't waste time requesting them

2- this is not case sensitive or order sensitive or even waiting for something meaning these will work np `a   2` -- `,c23` -- `2m,` -- `RAnDOM`

3- if you add "," to "a" it will not do anything 

4- sending any unexpected characters will "pass" it like it never happened and you will go back to promote

5- you have to write the letters (a) or words (random) correctly otherwise it won't work

6- Adding "AC" (two orders at the same time) won't work


## Future plans and features

**features**
- delete complete tasks
- delete one task
- adding colors and animations while keeping everything super fast
- time for tasks and priority
- date to each task to expand it to be weekly used or monthly
- print the index of the lines or have a table
- 

**currents todos to make it better**
- edit function's names and orders
- better the code itself and how to handle the tasks
- adding gif to the GitHub readme.md to make it easier to understand
- fixing some of the English writing üíÄ
